keyMessage: historical NAV is research evidence, not paper/live performance.
Scene 1 (0–3.2s): frozen strategy and QQQ paths self-draw; axis and historical date remain visible → svg-path-draw.
Scene 2 (3.2–6.4s): three verification chips enter on narration cues; the chart holds readable → dynamic-content-sequencing.
Scene 3 (6.4–11s): cursor follows baked curve to a recorded historical buy, readout reveals real ticker/quantity/price; journal excerpt appears → chart-scrub-readout.

# Chart Scrub Readout

The chart is already ON screen — this rule **interrogates** it. A vertical tracking line rides the scrub position, a marker dot follows the series, and a live tooltip reads out `date: value` per position, values flickering past like an odometer. It's the "this data is real — look closer" beat: the scrub proves the chart is an instrument, not a picture.

Boundary with its neighbors: [stat-bars-and-fills.md](stat-bars-and-fills.md) owns the chart's ARRIVAL; [counting-dynamic-scale.md](counting-dynamic-scale.md) owns a single number swelling in place. This rule assumes the graphic already exists and adds a **read head** moving across it. The three chain naturally: the line draws in (svg-path-draw / stat-bars), this rule scrubs it, and the landing value hands off to a count-up lockup.

## How It Works

1. **Data baked at setup** — a literal `DATA` array of `{ d, v }` points (or a pure index formula). The polyline's `points` attribute is computed ONCE from `DATA` by pure mapping functions: chart and readout share one source of truth. The argument of the shot is "this data is real" — a random walk regenerated per render breaks both determinism and the rhetorical claim.
2. **One driver tween** `p: 0 → 1` derives everything in its `onUpdate`: tracking-line x, marker x/y, tooltip position. Every output is a pure function of `p` — any seek lands the identical frame. Parallel tweens that merely share timing drift apart under rounding and read as chart chrome, not a read head.
3. **The marker rides the polyline** — its y interpolates between the two neighboring baked points, from the same arrays that built the chart; a separately-keyframed marker inevitably floats off the line.
4. **The readout is threshold-stepped** — the nearest data index derives from `p`, and `textContent` is written ONLY when that index changes (last-index guard). Transforms glide per frame (compositor-cheap); text steps per data point — no per-frame DOM text thrash. The guard is an optimization, not state: any seek recomputes the same index and the same text.

## Recipe

```html

</div>
```

```css
.tooltip {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  min-width: TIP_MIN_WIDTH; /* fixed — the box must not resize as values change length */
}
#tip-value {
  font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums; /* MANDATORY — digits flicker past; widths must not */
}
```

```js
// Data baked at setup — literal values.
const DATA = [
  { d: "{date1}", v: V1 },
  // ... N points, chronological ...
];

// Pure mapping functions — geometry derives from DATA once.
const PAD = CHART_PAD;
const PLOT_W = CHART_W - PAD * 2;
const PLOT_H = CHART_H - PAD * 2;
const vals = DATA.map((p) => p.v);
const V_MIN = Math.min(...vals);
const V_MAX = Math.max(...vals);
const X = (i) => PAD + (i / (DATA.length - 1)) * PLOT_W;
const Y = (v) => PAD + PLOT_H * (1 - (v - V_MIN) / (V_MAX - V_MIN));

document
  .getElementById("series-a")
  .setAttribute("points", DATA.map((p, i) => `${X(i)},${Y(p.v)}`).join(" "));

const line = document.getElementById("track-line");
const marker = document.getElementById("marker");
const tooltip = document.getElementById("tooltip");
const tipDate = document.getElementById("tip-date");
const tipValue = document.getElementById("tip-value");

// Tooltip pops in as the scrub begins — a small fromTo scale/opacity spring at SCRUB_AT.

// ONE driver — line, marker, and tooltip are all projections of p.
const scrub = { p: 0 };
let lastIdx = -1;
tl.to(
  scrub,
  {
    p: 1,
    duration: SCRUB_DUR,
    ease: SCRUB_EASE,
    onUpdate: () => {
      const f = scrub.p * (DATA.length - 1); // fractional index
      const i = Math.min(DATA.length - 2, Math.floor(f));
      const t = f - i;
      const x = X(i) + (X(i + 1) - X(i)) * t;
      const y = Y(DATA[i].v) + (Y(DATA[i + 1].v) - Y(DATA[i].v)) * t;

      // Transforms glide every frame (cheap, deterministic)
      line.setAttribute("x1", x);
      line.setAttribute("x2", x);
      marker.setAttribute("cx", x);
      marker.setAttribute("cy", y);
      tooltip.style.transform = `translate(${x + TIP_DX}px, ${y - TIP_DY}px)`;

      // Text steps only when the nearest data point changes
      const idx = Math.round(f);
      if (idx !== lastIdx) {
        tipDate.textContent = DATA[idx].d;
        tipValue.textContent = `${DATA[idx].v.toLocaleString()} {unitLabel}`;
        lastIdx = idx;
      }
    },
  },
  SCRUB_AT,
);
// End hold: the driver finishes before the scene does — the landed value reads.
```

## Variations

- **Peak stop** — the scrub is the wind-up, the landing is the stat: `SCRUB_EASE: "power3.out"` decelerates onto the final/peak point, then pop the emphasis at landing (`fromTo` marker `scale: 1 → PEAK_POP_SCALE` at `SCRUB_AT + SCRUB_DUR`). Pair with a pill tooltip that springs to its final label ([spring-pop-entrance.md](spring-pop-entrance.md)) — the classic "line breaks above the band" climax.
- **Second-series activation on cross** — series B sits dimmed; at `SCRUB_AT + SCRUB_DUR * CROSS_P` tween its stroke to the lit color (0.25s, `power2.out`), and in the driver's `onUpdate` read from B's array once `scrub.p ≥ CROSS_P` (still index-guarded). The color flip lands ON the cross — same-frame causality.
- **Two-chart glide** — two scrub beats: sweep chart A, glide the cursor/tooltip group across the gutter (a plain `x` tween, no readout — dead travel, not data), then chart B activates with its own driver. One driver per chart.
- **Cursor-led scrub** — an oversized cursor is the visible actor: another projection of the SAME driver (positioned from `x` in the same `onUpdate`, tip at the tracking line's head) — never a second tween that merely matches timing. Cursor look and click grammar from [cursor-click-ripple.md](cursor-click-ripple.md).
- **Playhead form** — no cursor; the tracking line IS the actor (timeline scrubbers, audio waves, session replays). `ease: "none"` — mechanical playback, not a hand.

## Critical Constraints

- **`DATA` is literal at setup**; polyline points derive from it via pure functions — chart and readout share one source of truth.
- **Seed at setup** — call the scrub applier once with `p = 0` right after building (à la `3d-camera-flight`'s `applyCamera()`), or a seek to t=0 before the driver runs shows the tracking line/marker at their HTML-default positions.
- **Single driver** — one `p` tween; all scrub outputs (line, marker, tooltip, any cursor) computed in its `onUpdate`, each a pure function of `p`.
- **Readout writes guarded by index change** — `onUpdate` stays O(1): a few attribute sets, one transform, text only on step.
- **SVG `viewBox` units = CSS pixels** (`viewBox="0 0 W H"` with matching `width`/`height`) — one coordinate space must serve the SVG internals and the HTML tooltip's transform.
- **`tabular-nums` + fixed `min-width`** on the tooltip value.
- **The chart pre-exists** — draw-in belongs to `svg-path-draw` / `stat-bars-and-fills`; sequence it BEFORE the scrub, don't blend them.
- **Land the read** — hold the final value ≥0.8s (or hand off to a count-up lockup).

# Dynamic Content Sequencing

A utility pattern (not a motion rule in itself) for scenes that show a SEQUENCE of items (cards, phrases, stats): each item's duration is computed from its content length + per-item config, and the sequencer assigns absolute start/end times automatically — no hardcoded offsets per item. Distinct from [discrete-text-sequence](discrete-text-sequence.md) (one text element changing states) — this rule swaps between distinct content blocks.

## How It Works

A content array of `{ eyebrow, title, body, speedFactor, hold }` entries is reduced once at build time into a flat `TIMELINE` of `{ …entry, start, end }` — duration per entry is `BASE_DURATION + body.length × SEC_PER_CHAR + hold`, so longer text earns more reading time. A single linear driver's `onUpdate` reverse-searches the active entry and swaps the DOM **only on transitions** (a `lastTitle` guard — per-frame `textContent` writes flicker in render); an optional progress bar fills 0→100% across the whole run.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<div class="display">
  <div class="eyebrow" id="eyebrow"></div>
  <div class="title" id="title"></div>
  <div class="body" id="body"></div>
  <div class="progress-bar"><div class="progress-fill" id="progress-fill"></div></div>
</div>
```

```css
.body {
  min-height: 160px; /* reserve space — content height varies; without this, layout jumps */
}
.progress-fill {
  height: 100%;
  width: 0%;
}
```

```js
// N entries, each with its own pacing (optionally a speedFactor multiplier);
// the final entry uses a larger hold (closing beat).
const CONTENT = [
  { eyebrow: "{eyebrow1}", title: "{title1}", body: "{body1}", hold: HOLD_MID },
  // …
  { eyebrow: "{eyebrowN}", title: "{titleN}", body: "{bodyN}", hold: HOLD_FINAL },
];

// Pre-compute absolute start/end ONCE — never in onUpdate.
let cumulative = 0;
const TIMELINE = CONTENT.map((entry) => {
  const dur = BASE_DURATION + entry.body.length * SEC_PER_CHAR + entry.hold;
  const start = cumulative;
  cumulative += dur;
  return { ...entry, start, end: cumulative };
});

function entryAt(time) {
  for (let i = TIMELINE.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    if (time >= TIMELINE[i].start) return TIMELINE[i];
  }
  return TIMELINE[0];
}

const eyebrowEl = document.getElementById("eyebrow");
const titleEl = document.getElementById("title");
const bodyEl = document.getElementById("body");
const progressEl = document.getElementById("progress-fill");

const TOTAL_DURATION = cumulative + TAIL_PAD;
const driver = { t: 0 };
let lastTitle = "";

tl.to(
  driver,
  {
    t: TOTAL_DURATION,
    duration: TOTAL_DURATION,
    ease: "none",
    onUpdate: () => {
      const entry = entryAt(driver.t);
      // Swap content only on transitions — no per-frame DOM thrash
      if (entry.title !== lastTitle) {
        eyebrowEl.textContent = entry.eyebrow;
        titleEl.textContent = entry.title;
        bodyEl.textContent = entry.body;
        lastTitle = entry.title;
      }
      progressEl.style.width = `${(driver.t / TOTAL_DURATION) * 100}%`;
    },
  },
  0,
);
```

## Variations

- **Crossfade between items** — return BOTH adjacent entries during an overlap window (`time ≥ e.start − overlap && time ≤ e.end + overlap`, overlap ≈ 0.3s) and render them with opacities computed from distance to the boundary.
- **Per-item motion variation** — map an `entry.style` key to an existing rule per chapter (e.g. `3d-text-depth-layers` → `hacker-flip-3d` → `counting-dynamic-scale`); the sequencer only orchestrates timing.
- **Auto-extend composition duration** — you can set `data-duration` from the computed `TOTAL_DURATION` in script, but HF reads `data-duration` at composition load and setting it after init may not take effect — author the duration manually from a rough total.

### Accelerating cadence (geometric hold decay)

For rhetorical escalation — "everyone says…", a roll-call, a praise flurry — the beat grid itself accelerates: early entries hold ~1s (read speed), then windows shrink geometrically into a ~0.15–0.3s flurry, braking on an emphasis state before the resolve. The acceleration is pre-computed into the same flat `TIMELINE` — still content-driven, still deterministic, no speed-up tween anywhere:

```js
// Geometric decay on the hold, clamped at a flurry floor; the brake state holds longest.
const HOLDS = CONTENT.map((entry, i) => Math.max(FLURRY_FLOOR, HOLD_START * Math.pow(DECAY, i)));
HOLDS[CONTENT.length - 1] = HOLD_FINAL;

let cumulative = 0;
const TIMELINE = CONTENT.map((entry, i) => {
  // Past ~0.5s states are glanced as motion texture, not read —
  // drop the per-char term or you never reach flurry speed.
  const readable = HOLDS[i] >= READ_THRESHOLD;
  const dur = HOLDS[i] + (readable ? entry.body.length * SEC_PER_CHAR : 0);
  const start = cumulative;
  cumulative += dur;
  return { ...entry, start, end: cumulative };
});
```

Worked example — **praise-chip flurry**: ~16 short quotes hard-cut through a chip beside a pinned wordmark. First 3 states at `HOLD_START = 1.0` (each reads fully); `DECAY = 0.8` shrinks every following window until `FLURRY_FLOOR = 0.2` catches it (≈12 states over ~2.5s — a churn of acclaim, individually glanced); the longest phrase takes `HOLD_FINAL ≈ 1.6` as the brake before the closing lockup.

Values: `HOLD_START` 0.8–1.2s; `DECAY` 0.75–0.88 (higher = longer runway before the flurry bites); `FLURRY_FLOOR` 0.15–0.3s (below ~0.15s swaps strobe); `READ_THRESHOLD` ~0.5s; brake ≥ 4× the floor or the stop doesn't register as a beat. The 3–6 entry guidance relaxes here — 12–18 states are legal precisely because flurry states aren't individually read. The hard-cut discipline (`lastTitle` guard, instant swaps) is what lets 0.2s states render clean.

## Critical Constraints

- **Pre-compute the TIMELINE once at build** — never recompute in `onUpdate`; the reverse search over the flat array is the whole per-frame cost.
- **DOM swap only on entry transition** (`lastTitle`/key guard) — per-frame `textContent` assignment flickers in HF render.
- **`min-height` on the body element** — without reservation, downstream elements (progress bar, brand) jitter as content height varies.
- **Sequential only** — for parallel tracks use a different reduction.
- **Titles fit one line at the chosen size; bodies fit inside `min-height` after wrapping.**

# SVG Path Draw

Reveals an SVG shape by animating its stroke as if a pen were tracing it. Two stroke properties together: **`stroke-dasharray = <pathLength>`** makes the entire path one dash; **`stroke-dashoffset`** starts at the path length (dash shifted fully out of view → invisible) and tweens to `0` (fully drawn). The length comes from the DOM API `path.getTotalLength()` — measured, never guessed.

Works on anything with a stroke: `<path>`, `<circle>`, `<rect>`, `<line>`, `<polyline>`, `<polygon>`, `<ellipse>`.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip -->
<svg class="logo-mark" viewBox="0 0 200 200" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <path id="bar-left" d="M 60 40 L 60 160" />
  <path id="bar-right" d="M 140 40 L 140 160" />
  <path id="bar-mid" d="M 60 100 L 140 100" />
</svg>
```

```css
.logo-mark path {
  fill: none; /* outline-only draw — a fill would appear immediately and ruin the reveal */
  stroke: {accentColor};
  stroke-width: 12;
  stroke-linecap: round; /* softer endpoints */
  stroke-linejoin: round;
}
```

```js
// Setup: measure each path and set its dash pattern. Real measured geometry, not a magic number.
document.querySelectorAll(".logo-mark path").forEach((p) => {
  const len = p.getTotalLength();
  p.style.strokeDasharray = `${len}`;
  p.style.strokeDashoffset = `${len}`;
});

// Stagger draws so the eye reads continuous motion — each segment starts at
// ~70-80% of the previous segment's duration, before it finishes.
tl.to(
  "#bar-left",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_1_START,
);
tl.to(
  "#bar-right",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_2_START,
);
tl.to(
  "#bar-mid",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: FINAL_SEGMENT_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_3_START,
);

// Companion wordmark fades in only after the last stroke settles.
tl.to(
  ".brand-line",
  { opacity: 1, duration: BRAND_FADE_DUR, ease: "power1.out" },
  BRAND_FADE_START,
);
```

## Variations

- **Ring starting at 12 o'clock** — `<circle>` / `<rect>` strokes start at 3 o'clock by default; rotate the element `-90deg` so a progress ring draws from the top:

```html
<circle
  cx="100"
  cy="100"
  r="60"
  id="ring"
  style="transform-origin: 100px 100px; transform: rotate(-90deg)"
/>
```

- **Linear (constant-speed) draw** — `ease: "none"` for a steady-rate "real pen" trace.
- **Draw then fill** — for filled shapes, tween `fillOpacity: 0 → 1` AFTER the stroke completes (requires `fill-opacity: 0` initially and a real `fill` in CSS):

```js
tl.to(
  "#path",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_1_START,
);
tl.to(
  "#path",
  { fillOpacity: 1, duration: FILL_FADE_DUR, ease: "power1.out" },
  SEG_1_START + SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR,
);

| token             | range                                   | notes                                                                                              |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR  | 0.3–0.8s                                | fast snap vs deliberate pen trace; >~1s feels sluggish for a logo reveal                           |
| FINAL_SEGMENT_DUR | 60–80% of SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR              | proportional to segment length — a short connector at full duration reads slower than its siblings |
| SEG_N_START       | previous start + 70–80% of its duration | reads as continuous motion, not N isolated animations                                              |
| SEG_1_START       | 0–0.4s                                  | a small ~0.2s lead-in lets the viewer settle before motion                                         |
| BRAND_FADE_START  | ≥ last stroke end (+ ~0.2s beat)        | earlier and the wordmark competes with the draw                                                    |
| BRAND_FADE_DUR    | 0.3–0.8s                                | snap (urgent) vs glide (premium)                                                                   |

Ease families are discrete choices: **stroke draws** use `power2.out` (a hand lifting at end of stroke) or `none` for constant speed — never `back.out` / `elastic.out` (pens don't bounce). **Fades** use `power1.out`.

## Critical Constraints

- **`fill: none`** for outline-only draws — otherwise the fill appears immediately.
- **Dasharray/dashoffset = the measured `getTotalLength()`**, set at setup; requires the SVG in the DOM (inline SVG is fine; a loaded `<image>` SVG is not).
- **Complex paths**: if `getTotalLength()` looks wrong, overestimate slightly (`len * 1.05`) — too large is invisible at animation start; too small clips the end.
- **Stagger multi-path draws at ~70–80%** of the previous segment's duration.
- **A drawn line must land on something.** When the path is a connector (rail, beam, underline, callout) rather than a shape, both endpoints must sit on real elements and the draw must do a job — reveal, route, validate, or emphasize. A stroke that only decorates empty space reads as filler; attach it or cut it.
